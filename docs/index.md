Aspiring software engineer and current MIT student (class of 2025).

I want the ability to make software that I think should exist in the world. Right now, for me this means projects related to Tetris. I've been a top NES Tetris player for years and have achieved several historic accomplishments, like [placing 2nd][ctwc] at the 2022 Classic Tetris World Championships and becoming the [first person][colors] to reach the game's glitched levels. I occasionally stream my gameplay on [Twitch][twitch], and even more occasionally upload highlights and technical content on [Youtube][yt].

Tetris also happens to be a weirdly good starting point for just about anything software related: through this game I got my start in fullstack development, learned game hacking (6502 assembly!), dabbled in [AI][ai], and even reverse engineered some exploits. To me, this is because Tetris is ultimately defined by its community, and their needs/desires are inherently complex and versatile. In my spare time, I enjoy climbing, eating weird food, and listening to weird music.
